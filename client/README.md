# Maht frontend client

## UX suggestions

- Create a background video, or at least something that pulses while gpt is in operation, I.e., talking with server
- like gpt-3, create stream (also requires much backend)
- buttons across as navigation for chat suggestions: 
	- What is a digital self?
	- Tell me about MyLife
	- Who founded
	- Mission
	- Values
- logo for Maht
- incorporate logo for MyLife

again, a lot of these structures would come from the GPT-2 instanec as tokenized requests for GPT-turbo
