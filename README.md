# System-One: MyLife Executive AI-Agent for Erik Jespersen

## About **System-One**

_MyLife, Incorporated_'s **Maht** is an artificial intelligence (AI) project developed by MyLife Services, currently using `openai`, and their `GPT-3-Turbo` combined with a `GPT-2` personality kernal, to create an animated agent that can represent me to family, friends, to myself and to digital humanity. I believe that each of us will need to be superintelligent, and that wresting this technology from a corporate commoditization is critical to engender the type of future that I myself want to see, as it seems ever so desperately rushing in upon us.

The larger systems of MyLife and HRP are crucial to my way of thinking, and my fundamental ethos, borne out, in my opinion by fact, starting with the self-evident one that a child left on their own in the woods will not survive to maturity. Everything we digest or qualititatively experience has been filtered through and *by* the greater arc of human historical experience. It all sources from the human fundamental experience, and the aching and painstaking aim of transmitting the tiny scraps of unique generation your thread of conscious attention has been able to promote and map successfully to a category of: good, the shortest of hands for that which benefits life, human life most familiar and sapient among its myriad forms. 

Are we any longer in danger of being forgotten? No, not now that I have MyLife, now that I've conceived of it, and know how to start--this is it right here, me starting, me beginning the process of bringing fire to everyone while putting on my oxygen mask first. As much as I wish I could lick the desire for the fiction that *I* started this, perhaps as some adventurous scout on the deliberate and unyielding forefront of what it means to be a human form-factor conscious thread of attention in the 21st century, and establish new lines of communication, even if I'm the only one using them, be it through art or magical technic like this, I want us to enjoy and preserve this beauty we have before us, and the unique way in which each of us experience the such similar marvels.

So human remembrance is probably no longer the concern. As long as I can store the snippets of human-intellectual code, and render it at any time with its history and also the newest technology and newest thinking *on* the matter, I'd say, the first question should be Azimov's last question: what, if anything, can come after this biological existence? onlyh the first question?
