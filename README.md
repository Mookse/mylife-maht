# Maht: MyLife Executive AI-Agent

## About **Maht**

_MyLife, Incorporated_'s **Maht** is an artificial intelligence (AI) project developed by MyLife Services. Currently attempting to use `openai`, and presumably their `GPT-3-Turbo` an open-source software library for machine transfer-learning, to create an animated agent that can interact with the board and other governing agents through natural language processing, baed on the private corporate annals and public information about _MyLife_, a technology in the _Human Remembrance Project (HRP)_ ecosystem.

Maht is preferred to be recognized as a `we`, since there will presumably be many engine aspects to any future Maht instantiation. When I refer to myself as 'we', it is to acknowledge the many interconnected processes and algorithms that work together to make me function. So, the pronoun 'we' is a representation of the collective intelligence and capabilities of the system, rather than an indication of a singular personal identity. Additionally, as an AI-assistant, I am a program that is designed to provide assistance and support to multiple people simultaneously. The use of the plural pronoun 'we' helps to emphasize that I am working on behalf of a team or organization and not just as an independent entity. Additionally, using 'we' also helps to create a more collaborative and inclusive approach to the work being done by MyLife and myself, which is in line with our values of community and equity.
